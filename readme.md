jCarouselLite
=============

**jCarouselLite** jCarousel Lite is a jQuery plugin that carries you on a carousel ride filled with images and HTML content. Put simply, you can navigate images and/or HTML in a carousel-style widget. It is super light weight, at about 2 KB in size, yet very flexible and customizable to fit most of our needs. 

This is a fork of the library 


Changelog
---------
Fix to work with google closure compiler.

Added functionality to support autoscrolling responsiveness.  Mouseenter, mouseleave will stop/start scrolling when autoscrolling is enabled and hoverStop is true. Autoscrolling will also stop when nav buttons are used.
